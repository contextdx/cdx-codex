Synchronize local architecture analysis to ContextDX, board by board.

## Prerequisites

Before syncing, ensure:

1. At least one analysis has been run (`.contextdx/boards/manifest.json` exists with board entries)
2. Configuration is set up (`.contextdx/config.json` exists with credentials)

## Sync Modes

### Sync a specific board

```
/sync --board <board-slug>
```

Syncs a single board to ContextDX.

### Sync all boards

```
/sync --all
```

Reads the manifest and syncs all boards that have analysis data.

### Default (no args)

```
/sync
```

If only one board exists, syncs it. If multiple exist, lists them and asks which to sync.

## Sync Workflow

### Step 1: Read Configuration

Read `.contextdx/config.json` and extract ContextDX credentials:

- `bindingToken`: Combined authentication token
- `apiSecret`: API secret (starts with `ck_cp_live_`)
- `baseUrl`: API endpoint (default: `https://platform.contextdx.com/api`)
- `branch`: Git branch name for sync
- `boardSlug`: Root board slug

If configuration is missing or `boardSlug` is not set, instruct the user to run `/login` (browser) or `/configure` (manual) first.

### Step 2: Load Board Manifest

Read `.contextdx/boards/manifest.json` to discover which boards exist and their metadata. If the manifest doesn't exist, instruct the user to run `/analyze` first.

### Step 3: Determine Boards to Sync

Based on the mode:
- `--board <slug>`: Sync only that board (validate it exists in manifest)
- `--all`: Sync all boards in the manifest
- Default: If one board, sync it; if multiple, prompt user

### Step 3.5: Ensure Boards Exist on Server

Before pushing elements, ensure all target boards exist on the server. Run the boards CLI in ensure mode:

```bash
node ${PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/cdx-boards.js \
  --ensure-boards .contextdx/boards/manifest.json
```

This:
1. Fetches existing boards from the server
2. Compares against the local manifest
3. Creates any missing child boards via `POST /code-plugin/boards`
4. Reports: X created, Y already existed, Z errors

Parse the JSON output:
- `created`: Board slugs that were newly created on the server
- `existing`: Board slugs that already existed (no action needed)
- `errors`: Board slugs that failed to create — warn the user but continue syncing boards that do exist
- `boardUrls`: Map of board slug → clickable "view this board" URL (built by the server). A value may be `null` when the server can't resolve it. **Keep this map** — you'll print these links in Step 6 after each board syncs.

If any boards failed to create, warn the user. Boards that failed will likely cause 404 errors during sync — skip them and report at the end.

### Step 4: Sync Each Board via CLI

For each board to sync, run the ContextDX sync CLI with the board's analysis file and board slug:

```bash
node ${PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/cdx-sync.js \
  --board-slug <board-slug> \
  --analysis .contextdx/boards/<board-slug>.json \
  --mode merge \
  --smart-sync
```

**CLI Options:**

- `--board-slug <slug>`: **Required** — board slug to sync to
- `--analysis <path>`: **Required** — analysis file path
- `--config <path>`: Config file path (default: `.contextdx/config.json`, rarely needed)
- `--mode <mode>`: Push mode - `merge` (default) or `replace`
- `--dry-run`: Validate and transform only, don't push to API
- `--smart-sync`: Enable diff-based sync (pulls server state, computes diff, pushes only changes)
- `--force-pull`: Force refresh of server elements before computing diff
- `--force-push`: Push all elements regardless of diff results

### Step 5: Parse CLI Output

The CLI outputs JSON to stdout:

**Success (smart sync mode):**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "boardSlug": "my-project-overview",
  "smartSync": true,
  "nodeCount": 10,
  "edgeCount": 15,
  "diff": {
    "newNodes": 3,
    "changedNodes": 2,
    "unchangedNodes": 5,
    "serverOnlyNodes": 1,
    "newEdges": 4,
    "changedEdges": 1,
    "unchangedEdges": 10,
    "serverOnlyEdges": 0
  },
  "pushResult": {
    "nodesCreated": 3,
    "nodesUpdated": 2,
    "edgesCreated": 4,
    "edgesUpdated": 1,
    "errors": []
  },
  "serverPullStatus": "fresh",
  "timing": {
    "totalMs": 1234,
    "pullMs": 456,
    "diffMs": 12,
    "pushMs": 766
  }
}
```

**Error:**

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "boardSlug": "my-project-overview",
  "error": "Configuration file not found",
  "errorCode": 1
}
```

If the JSON has `"errorType": "auth_invalid"`, the credentials were rejected (revoked binding or rotated secret) — tell the user to run `/login` to reconnect (or re-check `/configure`), rather than reporting a generic API error.

### Step 6: Report Results

For each synced board, report:
- Board slug and layer
- Nodes: X created, Y updated
- Edges: X created, Y updated
- Any errors from the `pushResult.errors` array
- **View link**: if `boardUrls[<board-slug>]` (from Step 3.5) is a non-null URL, print it as a clickable link, e.g. `🔗 View board: <url>`. If it's `null` or absent, skip the link silently (don't surface an error — the server may be older or the link not yet resolvable).

If syncing multiple boards, show a summary at the end, including each board's view link where available.

## Error Handling

### CLI Exit Codes

- `0`: Success
- `1`: Configuration error (missing file, invalid format, missing --board-slug)
- `2`: Analysis file error (missing or invalid JSON, missing boardSlug in metadata)
- `3`: Validation error (invalid node/edge structure or archetype mismatch)
- `4`: API error (auth failure, network error, push errors)

### Claude Code Plugin API Errors

- 400: Bad Request - Invalid payload or branch mismatch
- 401: Unauthorized - Invalid or missing API credentials
- 403: Access denied - Check binding permissions
- 404: Not Found - Binding or board not found
- 422: Invalid data format - Validate node/edge structure
- 429: Rate limited - Wait and retry
