argument-hint: "[--purge]"
allowed-tools: Bash

Disconnect this codebase from ContextDX by clearing the credentials in
`.contextdx/config.json`. By default the board, branch, and server settings are
kept so a later `/login` reconnects in one confirm; `--purge` resets the whole
config to its defaults. This is a **local** disconnect — the display explains
the server-side caveat.

## Workflow

1. Run the logout phase (add `--purge` only if the user asked for a full reset):

   ```bash
   node ${PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/cdx-login.js --logout
   ```

2. Print the JSON `display` field **verbatim** — never reformat, summarise, or
   rebuild it. It already covers what was cleared, the server-side caveat, and
   the next command (`/login`).

3. On a non-zero exit, print `display` verbatim and stop.
