description: Analyse the codebase for archetype gaps and submit proposals before running full /analyze
argument-hint: [--dry-run | --skip-submit | --force | --replace]
allowed-tools: Read, Glob, Grep, Write, Bash(node:*, git:*), AskUserQuestion
---

Phase 1 of the two-phase workflow: settle the **vocabulary** before describing the system. Scans the codebase for component categories, compares them against the server's archetype catalogue, and either confirms the catalogue is complete or proposes the missing archetypes for human approval.

After this command finishes (and any submitted proposals are approved), `/analyze` runs against a complete catalogue — no misfit archetypes, no post-hoc retyping.

## When to run

- Before `/analyze` on a fresh project.
- After any significant codebase change that introduces new component categories (e.g., adding CDK stacks to a previously codebase-only repo).
- After admin approves proposals you previously submitted — re-running confirms the catalogue is now complete and updates the lock file.

## Flags

| Flag | Effect |
| ---- | ------ |
| `--dry-run` | Run the scan, validate proposals locally + ask the server to dry-run, but do **not** persist or POST. No lock file written. |
| `--skip-submit` | Write `.contextdx/proposed-archetypes.json` for manual review; do not POST. Lock file records the scan but not a submission. |
| `--replace` | When submitting, send `mode='replace'` so duplicate-name pending rows are overwritten instead of rejected. |
| `--force` | Bypass the CLI's local hash guard when submitting. |

## Workflow

### Step 0: Configuration check

Verify `.contextdx/config.json` exists. If not, instruct the user to run `/login` (browser) or `/configure` (manual) first and exit.

### Step 1: Pull fresh archetype catalogue

```bash
node ${PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/cdx-archetypes.js --no-cache --kind code
```

Parse the `archetypes[]`, `nodeArchetypes[]`, and `edgeArchetypes[]` from the JSON output. Compute a stable hash of the archetype names list — this becomes the `catalogueHash` recorded in the lock file.

### Step 2: Archetype-only scan

Invoke the `architecture-analyzer` agent with `--archetypes-only` mode. The agent runs `/analyze` Steps 0, 3, 4, 5 (project detection → tech stack detection → component discovery + archetype classification) but stops there. It does **not** produce board JSON, edges, hierarchies, or manifest updates.

The agent's output is a payload conforming to `ArchetypeProposalPayloadSchema`:

```json
{
  "proposed": [ /* new-archetype candidates per archetype-analysis SKILL */ ],
  "improvements": [ /* improvement candidates: rename | split | redescribe | merge */ ]
}
```

The agent applies the heuristics in [`${PLUGIN_ROOT}/knowledge/archetype-analysis/SKILL.md`](../knowledge/archetype-analysis/SKILL.md) for both what to propose and what to skip.

### Step 3: Decision branches

#### Step 3a — no gaps

If `proposed[]` and `improvements[]` are both empty:

1. Write `.contextdx/archetype-analysis.lock.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "commitHash": "<git rev-parse HEAD>",
     "catalogueHash": "<from Step 1>",
     "scannedAt": "<ISO timestamp>",
     "submittedAt": null,
     "skippedAt": null,
     "proposalIds": []
   }
   ```
2. Print: *"Catalogue is complete for this codebase. You can now run `/analyze`."*
3. Exit 0.

#### Step 3b — gaps found

1. Print a summary table:

   ```
   PROPOSED (N)
     - lambda_function     (node) — covers 3 detected components
     - sns_topic           (edge) — covers 2 detected relations

   IMPROVEMENTS (M)
     - service [split] → http_service / worker_service — 12 components affected
   ```

2. If `--dry-run`: skip the prompt. Validate the payload via [scripts/cdx-propose-archetypes.js](../scripts/cdx-propose-archetypes.js) with `--dry-run` (which POSTs `?dryRun=true` to the server). Print result, do **not** write the lock. Exit 0.

3. If `--skip-submit`: write `.contextdx/proposed-archetypes.json`. Write the lock with `skippedAt: <ts>` (scan completed but submission was opted out — Phase 1 is *not* settled). Print: *"Proposals written for manual review. Edit the file and re-run /analyze-archetypes when ready. /analyze will re-prompt until Phase 1 finishes."* Exit 0.

4. Otherwise (interactive default): use AskUserQuestion with three options:
   - **Submit for review** (recommended) — proceed to Step 4.
   - **Edit first** — write `.contextdx/proposed-archetypes.json`. Write the lock with `skippedAt: <ts>` (same rationale as `--skip-submit` — Phase 1 is mid-flight). Print: *"Edit the file then re-run /analyze-archetypes to submit."* Exit 0.
   - **Skip and proceed** — write the lock with `skippedAt: <ts>`. Print: *"Skip is one-shot: every subsequent /analyze will re-prompt until you run /analyze-archetypes and submit (or confirm no gaps). Running /analyze now will type affected components with misfit archetypes. Re-run /analyze-archetypes then /analyze --clean after the missing archetypes land in the catalogue."* Exit 0.

> **Lock-shape note:** in all three branches the lock must include `commitHash` and `catalogueHash` (from Step 1) so [cdx-precondition.js](../scripts/cdx-precondition.js) can detect when subsequent /analyze runs are still aligned with this scan. `skippedAt` is always non-null in these branches — that field is what makes the precondition re-prompt.

### Step 4: Submit

Write `.contextdx/proposed-archetypes.json` with the payload from Step 2. Then invoke the submission CLI:

```bash
node ${PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/cdx-propose-archetypes.js \
  --proposals .contextdx/proposed-archetypes.json \
  --source-host codex --source-domain code \
  ${replace:+--replace} \
  ${force:+--force}
```

Parse the JSON output:

- `success: true` + `serverResult.acceptedProposed/acceptedImprovements`: print accepted count; record `proposalIds[]` from the response into the lock; set `submittedAt: <ts>`.
- `serverResult.rejected[]` non-empty: each entry has `existingProposalId` — surface to the user with the hint *"Already pending as proposalId=<id>; re-run with --replace to update it."*
- `success: false` + `serverResult.notAvailable: true`: server endpoint not deployed yet — leave the proposals file on disk; tell the user to retry after deployment. Do not write the lock.
- `errorCode: 3` (validation): surface `validated.errors[]`; let the user edit `.contextdx/proposed-archetypes.json` and re-run.

On success, print: *"N proposals submitted for admin review. The catalogue will be updated once an admin approves them in the ContextDX UI. Re-run `/analyze-archetypes` after approval, then proceed with `/analyze`."*

### Step 5: Persist lock

`.contextdx/archetype-analysis.lock.json` is the single source of truth used by [cdx-precondition.js](../scripts/cdx-precondition.js) (invoked by `/analyze` Step -1) and `/status` (display). Fields:

- `commitHash` — git HEAD at scan time
- `catalogueHash` — hash of archetype-name list at scan time
- `scannedAt` — ISO timestamp of the scan
- `submittedAt` — ISO timestamp if proposals were POSTed, else `null`
- `skippedAt` — ISO timestamp if the user opted to proceed with misfits, edit-first, or `--skip-submit`, else `null`. **Non-null `skippedAt` always re-prompts on the next `/analyze`** — it is intentionally not silenced.
- `proposalIds[]` — server-returned IDs for any submitted proposals (used by `/status` to query pending state)

Mapping from lock state to precondition status:

| Lock state | Precondition status | /analyze behaviour |
| ---------- | ------------------- | ------------------ |
| missing or hashes mismatch | `missing` / `stale_commit` / `stale_catalogue` | re-prompts |
| `skippedAt` set | `skipped` | re-prompts (one-shot semantics) |
| `submittedAt` + non-empty `proposalIds[]` | `pending` | warns and continues |
| `skippedAt: null`, `submittedAt: null`, empty `proposalIds[]`, hashes match | `ok` | proceeds silently |

Only Step 3a (no gaps) and Step 4 (after admin approval — re-running this command finds no new gaps) produce the `ok` state.

## Notes

- Approved proposals appear in `/code-plugin/archetypes` after admin review in the ContextDX UI. Until then, the live catalogue is unchanged — `/analyze` will warn if you have pending proposals submitted.
- This command does **not** write board JSONs. It is a pre-analysis vocabulary check only.
- See [knowledge/archetype-analysis/SKILL.md](../knowledge/archetype-analysis/SKILL.md) for what makes a good proposal and what should be skipped.
